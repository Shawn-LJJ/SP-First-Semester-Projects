                After I graduated from my current course of study, I am willing to pursue software, application, or programmer jobs within the field of IT.
                Although I would have learnt how to develop AI application, I may not necessary have to take up jobs that need the use of AI. 
                I simply enjoy the essence of coding, so any job as a programmer would do. Mainly application or software development, or any other fields such as data scientist,
                or AI application developer. I will be listing 3 job options that I am willing to partake on. The common skillsets match my strength in which I enjoy doing.

                            Followed by the actual writing of the computer code, and finally run test and debug any issues. Application developer also have to maintain and
                            troubleshoot the programs if any issue arises. Application developer requires skills such as analytical thinking, problem solving skills, time management,
